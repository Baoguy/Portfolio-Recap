        <p>Nonverbal communication shows to the use of body language, facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice to
            convey meaning without using words. It can include things like posture, eye contact, hand movements, and
            even the way someone breathes. Some nonverbal communication languages include the American sign language
            below. This is the alphabet of the sign language</p>

            <p>Another very useful system of hand signals was devised to help hearing-impaired people to communicate.
                The system, called sign language, uses special hand positions, gestures, and even facial expressions to
                represent words and phrases and finger spelling for words for which there are no signs. In the United
                States, American Sign Language, Signed English, and finger spelling are used by the hearing-impaired to
                communicate with each other and with people who can hear.</p>
