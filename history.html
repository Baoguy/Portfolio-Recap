        <p>Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, hoping to find a
            new route to Asia. Instead, he discovered the Caribbean islands and later mainland America. His voyages
            marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the Americas. However, Columbus's arrival
            also had devastating consequences for the indigenous populations, including disease, slavery, and forced
            conversion to Christianity.</p>

            <p>We now know that Columbus was not the first European to travel to the Americas. That honor goes to the
                Vikings who settled briefly in what is now Canada in approximately A.D. 1000. However, Columbus'
                courageous rediscovery opened the new lands to the eager Europeans.
