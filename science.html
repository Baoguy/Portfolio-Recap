                <p>History of atoms. The idea of atoms has been around since ancient Greek civilization. Later, John
                    Dalton ( 1766- 1844), an English chemist proposed an atomic theory. Dalton believed that all matter
                    was made up of small particles called atoms and that atoms could not be broken down any further.
                    There are three main items in the atoms here they are:

                <h4>Proton</h4>
                <h5>The proton (p) is a particle that has a positive charge. It has a mass 1,800 times larger than an
                    electron. The proton is found at the center of the atom inside the nucleus. A proton, shown by a
                    positive sign (+), balances out the negative charge of an electron.</h5>

                <h4>Neutron</h4>
                <h5>The neutron (n) is also found in the nucleus. It has nearly the same mass as the proton. However, it
                    is different from the proton in that it has no electric charge. It is neutral. Therefore, it is
                    neither positive nor negative.

                <h4>Electron</h4>
                <h5>The electron (e) is a particle that has a negative charge and is found outside the nucleus. It has
                    very little mass, its also subatomic particle that carries a negative electric charge and is located
                    outside the atomic nucleus.</h5>
