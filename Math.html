        <p>The Number Line
            The number line, shown below, is a graph that lets us represent the real numbers.



            To the left of zero are the negative numbers, and to the right are positive numbers. To graph a number,
            simply
            put a point at the location of that number. The following graph is of the number two.

        <p> Recall that lines go on forever in both directions. The arrows on the graph are important because they show
            that
            the numbers go on forever. The term used to describe this is infinity. Numbers continue infinitely in both
            the
            positive and negative directions.

            Distance on the number line means how many units there are between numbers. The distance between 1 and 6 is
            5
            units.
